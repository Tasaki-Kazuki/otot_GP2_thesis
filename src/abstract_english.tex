  In order to compete in bodybuilding competitions, it is important not only to muscle training and lose weight, but also to practice
posing. However, most posing practice is done using mirrors, making it difficult for beginners to master posing. Therefore, I am
going to create a system that judges poses using pose estimation technology, compares them with ideal poses, and gives feedback
to the user
